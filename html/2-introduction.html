<!--<!DOCTYPE html>: This is the document type declaration (not technically a tag). It declares a document as being an HTML document. 
    The doctype declaration is not case-sensitive.
<html>: This is called the HTML root element. All other elements are contained within it.
<head>: The head tag contains the “behind the scenes” elements for a webpage. Elements within the head aren’t visible on the front-end 
    of a webpage. HTML elements used inside the <head> element include: 
    <style>-This html tag allows us to insert styling into our webpages and make them appealing to look at with the help of CSS.
    <title>-The title is what is displayed on the top of your browser when you visit a website and contains the title of the webpage that 
    you are viewing.
    <base>-It specifies the base URL for all relative URL’s in a document.
    <noscript>– Defines a section of HTML that is inserted when the scripting has been turned off in the users browser.
    <script>-This tag is used to add functionality in the website with the help of JavaScript.
    <meta>-This tag encloses the meta data of the website that must be loaded every time the website is visited. 
        For eg:- the metadata charset allows you to use the standard UTF-8 encoding in your website. This in turn allows the users 
        to view your webpage in the language of their choice. It is a self closing tag.
    <link>– The ‘link’ tag is used to tie together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is self closing.
<body>: The body tag is used to enclose all the visible content of a webpage. In other words, the body content is what the browser 
    will show on the front-end.-->>
