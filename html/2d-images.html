<!--The image tag is used to insert an image into our web page. The source of the image to be inserted is put inside the 
    <img src=”source_of_image“> tag.

Image can be inserted in the image tag in two formats: – 
If the image is in the same folder, then we can just write the name of the image and the format as the path. 
If the image is in another folder, then we do need to mention the path of the image and the image name as well as the format of the image. 
Example: This example illustrates the use of the <img> tag for inserting the images in HTML.-->
